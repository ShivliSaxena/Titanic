Author- Shivli Saxena <br>
**Project Overview**<br>
This project is part of a classic beginner-level dataset from Kaggleâ€™s "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" competition. The goal is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck based on a set of features such as age, gender, class, and other personal data.<br>
**Tools & Technologies Used**<br>
Python<br>
Jupyter Notebook<br>
Pandas for data manipulation<br>
Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization<br>
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**<br>
Analyzed missing values and handled them appropriately<br>
Explored relationships between survival and features such as Sex, Pclass, Age, Fare, and Embarked<br>
Created visualizations to better understand feature distributions and correlations<br>
